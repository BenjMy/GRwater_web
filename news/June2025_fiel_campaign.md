Over the past few days, the **GRwater project** team has conducted an intensive field campaign in the **Agramon watershed**, affected by the 2019 wildfire. This phase of fieldwork allowed the deployment and validation of various technological tools to monitor **soil and vegetation recovery**.

ðŸ“¸ **1. Technology in action**  
UAV flights were carried out using **multispectral, thermal, and RGB cameras**, enabling the creation of high-resolution maps of **evapotranspiration**, **vegetation regeneration**, and **structural changes** in the terrain.

ðŸ“¸ **2. Electrical conductivity measurements**  
An **electromagnetic antenna** was used to measure **soil electrical conductivity**â€”an important indicator of hydrological status and **post-fire soil processes**.

ðŸ“¸ **3. Experimental plots**  
Sampling was conducted across plots with different **post-fire management treatments** (*mulching*, *log-erosion barriers*, *spontaneous recovery*) to assess their effectiveness in **promoting ecosystem restoration**.

ðŸ“¸ **4. Multidisciplinary collaboration**  
The fieldwork brought together experts in **soil science, geophysics, remote sensing, hydrology, and ecology**, showcasing the **integrative approach** of the GRwater project to address post-wildfire landscape challenges.
