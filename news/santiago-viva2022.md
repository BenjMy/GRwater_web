Please join me in congratulating
[Dr. Santiago Soler](https://www.santisoler.com/)
for successfully defending his thesis today and being awarded the title of PhD
in Geophysics by the Universidad Nacional de San Juan, Argentina!
🎉 🍾

Santiago was the first PhD student I had the chance to work with and I can
safely say that collaborating with him had a profound impact on my career.
He was instrumental in making [Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org/)
what it is today and has made numerous contributions to the field of gravimetry
throughout his PhD.

You can find his PhD thesis and defense slides (both in Spanish)
[on GitHub](https://github.com/santisoler/phd-thesis). Of course, all of the
LaTeX sources for the thesis are available as well!

I wish him all the best in his future career steps and hope to finally be able
meet him in person soon (after 5 years of online-only collaboration)!

Leo
