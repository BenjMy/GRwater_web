We have one open position for a fully funded 5-year PhD and graduate student
assistant position at the University of Liverpool.

**Applications are open until 21 April 2021**.

# Project: Improving estimates of Antarctic geothermal heat flow from geophysical data

The goals of this project are to 1) quantify the effect of merging magnetic
data from different surveys due to changes in the Earth's magnetic field and
crustal magnetization, 2) produce an integrated magnetic data compilation for
Antarctica that is less dependent on the direction of the Earth's field using
state-of-the-art processing methods, and 3) estimate the depth to the Curie
isotherm in Antarctica using the newly generated magnetic data. The magnetic
data integration and Curie depth estimation will be done by adapting methods
and software recently developed by the research group and our international
collaborators (for example, Hidalgo-Gato et al., 2021, and Reis et al., 2020).
By achieving these goals, we hope to quantify and reduce the uncertainty in the
Curie isotherm depth estimates for Antarctica, which is a key parameter in
determining geothermal heat flow in Antarctica (Lösing et al., 2020).

# The supervisory team

You will be working with me, [Leonardo Uieda][/people/uieda], as the primary advisor as well as
[Richard Holme](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/environmental-sciences/staff/richard-holme/)
from the University of Liverpool
and [Vanderlei Coelho Oliveira Jr.](https://www.pinga-lab.org/people/oliveira-jr.html)
from the [PINGA lab](https://www.pinga-lab.org) at the [Observatório Nacional, Brazil](https://on.br).

# Why work with us

Through this PhD, you will acquire the mathematical and Python programming
skills required to undertake the project. You will be trained to develop
software in a collaborative environment using GitHub and the current best
practices in research software engineering.

The project will be conducted
following the current established norms of open-science and reproducible
research, with all outputs published on the
[group's GitHub page](https://github.com/compgeolab).
Please read the [lab manual][/manual] for more information on our practices.

The project also has the potential to involve code
contributions to the different open-source Python [software developed by the
research group][/software], mainly [Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org),
leading to potential impact beyond standard scientific publications.

# What we are looking for

This position would suit someone with skills in (or who is willing to learn):

* Mathematics (linear algebra and calculus)
* Computer programming (any language)
* Numerical methods

An ideal candidate would also be motivated, able to self-study, and interested
in open-science practices and open-source software.

# The position, funding, and application

This position is for a Graduate Teaching Assistant at 0.5 full-time employment
(FTE) over a 5 year period.
The role includes supporting the programme of practical exercises in physical
geography, geospatial data analysis (geographical information systems),
earth surface processes and dynamics, and environmental sciences.
This project is one of eight eligible for funding support through the
recruitment of two GTAs within Geography & Planning and Earth Sciences.

The expectation is that no less than 50% of your time will be made available
for the pursuit of your PhD studies. The funding for the PhD includes tuition
fees and a research support budget £1000 per year.

In addition to your application for the PhD, you are also required to apply for
the 0.5 FTE University Teacher Salary (£29,177-£33,797 / year at 0.5 FTE pro
rata). Ensure that, in the funding section of the application form, you mark
your application "GTA SoES Post".

Applicants are encouraged to read the [lab manual][/manual] to familiarize
themselves with the way we approach science, expectations, our code of conduct,
etc.

**Open to applicants worldwide.**

# Background

The flow of heat coming from the Earth's interior is an important parameter to
consider when studying how ice sheets flow and deform. It also plays a key role
in determining how the Earth's crust rebounds upwards once ice mass is
displaced, influencing our estimates of sea-level rise among others. It is very
difficult to measure geothermal heat flow directly, particularly beneath the
kilometer-thick ice sheets in Antarctica. As such, we often rely on indirect
geophysical measurements to estimate heat flow on continental scales
(Burton-Johnson et al., 2020). One of the main geophysical methods used for
this purpose is magnetometry, the measurement of anomalies in the Earth's
magnetic field due to magnetized rocks in the crust. The magnetic anomaly data
allows us to estimate the depth at which magnetic minerals reach a temperature
that makes them lose their magnetic properties, known as the Curie isotherm
(Fox Maule et al., 2005; Martos et al., 2017). This provides information about
the temperature of the crust at depths of up to 60 kilometers.

When estimating Curie isotherm depths from magnetic data, we tend to assume
that 1) the crust is uniformly magnetized and 2) the magnetic data from
different surveys can be merged into a single dataset without errors. On the
scale of a continent, the magnetization of the crust is known to vary due to
the lateral changes in the Earth's magnetic field and the presence of remanent
magnetization in crustal rocks from the time of their formation. The magnetic
anomaly data are also dependent on the direction of the Earth's core field at
the time of acquisition. Since the Earth's field changes over time, merging
data from surveys conducted at different times can be problematic if this
effect is not taken into account. Nonetheless, these assumptions are often
required in practice due to incomplete information and a lack of better data
processing methods. The errors introduced by these failed assumptions may leak
into geothermal heat flow estimates and any predictions of ice sheet behaviour
and sea-level rise that are based upon them.
