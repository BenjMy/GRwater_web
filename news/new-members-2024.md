It's my pleasure to welcome the newest members of our team who have joined us
at [USP][usp] this year:

* [**Yago Moreira Castro**](../team#YagoMCastro) is starting his MSc to build
  [Magali](https://www.fatiando.org/magali/), our open-source software for
  magnetic microscopy.
* [**Arthur Siqueira de MacÃªdo**](../team#arthursmacedo) is starting his MSc
  and will be developing a gradient-boosted equivalent source method for large
  magnetic datasets in spherical coordinates. His project is part of our
  Antarctic magnetics research.
* **Ellen Fernandes Marcos** is starting her BSc dissertation project on block
  cross-validation methods for equivalent source processing of gravity data.
* **Gabriel Aparecido das Chagas Silva** is starting a research internship at
  the lab to update and further develop our [planting algorithm for inversion
  of potential field data](https://github.com/pinga-lab/paper-planting-densities).
* **Michel Leme Ibri** is starting a research internship at
  the lab to look at different ways of interpreting topography-corrected
  gravity disturbances versus topography curves.

It's always a pleasure to start new collaborations and I'm looking forward to
working with them on their projects and growing the team!
