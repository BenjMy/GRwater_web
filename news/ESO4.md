As part of our public dissemination activities we showcased our research activities to a few secondary school students ([Programme 4ยบ ESO + Empresa](https://delegacion.madrid.csic.es/programa-4o-eso-empresa/)) of Madrid.

Among other colleagues of Tech4Agro, we introduced them the value of geophysics for monitoring sub-soil physical processes as well as the interest of thermal infrared satellite to estimate evapotranspiration and water stress.
