I'm a bit late with this post but I would like to congratulate lab members
Aidan Hernaman, Ali Alhazmi, Daniel Gilbert, Majed Abura, and Mustafa Alordowny
for successfully completing their dissertations!
It was not an easy year but they all stepped up and delivered excellent work.
Aidan still has one more year to complete his MESci degree
while Ali, Daniel, Majed, and Mustafa have graduated from the University of
Liverpool.
Working with them was a real pleasure and our regular weekly meetings did
wonders to mitigate the isolation of working from home during the pandemic.

**Please join me in wishing the new geophysicists all the best in their future
careers!** ðŸ¥‚
