The lab is based primarily at {{ config.location.school }} in the Butantã
campus of {{ config.location.university }}.
See below for opportunities to join the lab.

## General guidelines

Before applying to join the lab or starting a collaboration, please
read {{ macros.page_link("manual/open-science", page, site) }} and
{{ macros.page_link("manual/authorship", page, site) }}.
These sections outline our core principles as scientists and it's important
that you are aware of and agree with these principles to a large extent.

If you feel like we would be a good match, the best thing is to **contact Leo
first** to see if he is able to take on more students and postdocs.
We aim to foster a small and healthy research group, where everyone has the
time and support they need to thrive.
Unfortunately, this means that sometimes we cannot take on new members.

When writing to Leo to inquire about opportunities, please mention **specific
examples** of things you'd like to work on. What are your interests? What about
the group made you want to join? What are your career goals? You don't need to
have a concrete idea but it helps to demonstrate that you've looked at our
research and have given this some thought.

## Undergraduate students

We're interested in undergraduate students who want to pursue research in any
of our research themes, including open-source software development.
Students from any degree programme are welcome as long as they have a basic
background in calculus, physics, and computer programming.
**The most important characteristic we're looking for is curiosity and
motivation to learn independently**.
If this is you, then get in touch with Leo!

There are several opportunities for scientific initiation scholarships which we
can pursue (PUB, PIBIC, FAPESP). In general, students first start working
a small amount of hours on a volunteer basis to see if there is a good match
with the lab before applying for a scholarship.

## Graduate students

Applications are handled by the
[Geophysics graduate program](https://www.iag.usp.br/pos-graduacao/geofisica)
at IAG.
However, please **speak with Leo before applying** if you're interested in
joining the lab.
This is a requirement for PhD students and highly encouraged for MSc students.
While MSc students can apply without having a supervisor, there is no guarantee
that the lab will be able to accommodate you even if you are offered a place in
the programme.

The programme has a good number of CAPES **scholarships** for both **national
and international students**.
There is no relocation funding so you'll have to make your way to São Paulo
using your own funds.
We can also apply for [FAPESP scholarships](https://fapesp.br/bolsas), which
pay significantly more but are harder to get.
If this is something you want to do, then please let Leo know and we should
apply as soon as possible (even before you are officially accepted into the
graduate programme).

## Postdocs

FAPESP has the [best scholarships](https://fapesp.br/bolsas/pd) for postdocs
and accepts national and international applicants.
Their scholarships are very generous and are usually tax-free in Brazil.
There are other scholarships available from time to time so it's good to check
with Leo if there is anything that would suite you.

There is no entry requirements or selection process in the department for
postdocs. So it's mostly a matter of finding funding for a scholarship.
That said, postdocs are **expected to be independent researchers** and bring
their own project ideas.
