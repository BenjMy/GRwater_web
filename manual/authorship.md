The following guidelines apply to publications involving lab members.
<strong>If you want to collaborate with the lab, please make sure you understand and
agree with them.</strong>

## General principles

* **We do not view authorship as a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game)**.
* Authorship in publications should be explicitly discussed between everyone
  involved **as early as possible**, ideally as soon as a project starts.
* Projects that lab members bring with them **do not** automatically confer
  authorship rights to either Leo or other lab members.
* However, if work is conducted on them during the course of being present in
  the lab, acknowledgments would be appreciated (funding acknowledgments are
  necessary).
* Projects that are collaborated on between lab members confer authorship to
  those directly involved, whether that collaboration is intellectual,
  technical, or data sharing. For example, writing code to support analysis or
  simulation would confer authorship.
* Sharing information during group meetings does not automatically confer
  authorship.
* If material intellectual contributions (i.e., new directions, solutions to
  problems, specific and directed project ideas) are made by lab members, that
  would confer authorship.

## External collaborations

* Please keep Leo apprised of the broad outlines of your external and internal
  collaborations.
* You do not have to involve Leo or grant him authorship in your external
  collaborations (though he will probably be happy to be involved if asked).

## Project ownership

This is meant from a social, rather than a licensing or intellectual
property, perspective.

* When a project is developed in the lab primarily by a single participant,
  that participant is free to continue developing and assuming project
  leadership once they have departed the lab.
* Developing projects that mature, grow, and may contribute to their future
  career is a key part of the process of scientific development.
* For projects that are collaboratively developed with multiple roughly equal
  participants, leadership will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Preference
  is given to providing intellectual freedom and empowerment to earlier-stage
  researchers.
* Projects that are part of a strategic lab direction may continue to be
  developed within the lab following departure of a primary developer.
  Decisions about "forking" or bifurcating development will be held on a
  case-by-case basis.
