When you first join the lab (ideally within the first few weeks), you will have
a meeting with Leo to introduce lab protocols, set expectations, add you to
communication channels, etc.

</div>

## Things to do after joining the lab

1. Create an account on the chat room (see {{ macros.page_link("manual/communication", page, site) }}) and send Leo a message (`@leouieda`) so he can add you to the `CompGeoLab` channel.
1. Install the [Mattermost app][mattermost]. You don't need to have it on your phone if you prefer not to, but at least install it on your computer.
1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Make sure your username is something that you would be OK putting on a publication or your CV (so nothing offensive, please).
1. Send Leo a message with your GitHub username so he can add you to the [lab GitHub organization][gh].
1. Read the [lab Code of Conduct][coc] carefully.
1. Go over the rest of lab manual again on your own.
1. Study the [Software Carpentry][swc] lessons on Version Control with Git, Python, and the Unix Shell. They will be crucial for your project. Go over Git and the Unix Shell first.
1. Explore the GitHub organization to see what the group is working on.
1. Add yourself to the website (if you want). See the [Contributing Guide][website-contrib] for instructions.
1. Read the main references for your project (if Leo doesn't send them to you, please remind him).
1. Go and start making something brilliant!

## Leo's To Do list

1. Introduce the [lab website][website] and [GitHub organization][gh] where all
   our research projects live.
1. Go over this manual.
1. Send a message to the group introducing the new member.
1. Add them to the [lab GitHub organization][gh].
1. Send the main papers related to the new member's project.
