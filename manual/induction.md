title: On-boarding new members
---

When you first join the lab (ideally within the first few weeks), you will have
a meeting with Leo to introduce lab protocols, set expectations, add you to
communication channels, etc.

This is a checklist of things that we will cover during this induction meeting.

## Leo's to-do list

- Send invitation to the group chat room.
- Add to the [lab GitHub organization][gh].

## Before your meeting

- Join the chat room and setup [Element](https://element.io/) on your computer/tablet/phone.
- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Send Leo a message with your GitHub username.

## During the meeting

Go over key information about:

- The lab manual, expectations, and practices.
- The [lab GitHub organization][gh] where all our research projects live.
- The [lab website][website] and how you can add yourself to it.

## After your meeting

- Read the [Code of Conduct][coc] carefully.
- Add yourself to the website (if you want). See the [Contributing Guide][website-contrib] for instructions.
- Go over the lab manual again on your own.
- Study the [Software Carpentry][swc] lessons on Version Control with Git, Python, and the Unix Shell. They will be crucial for your project. Go over Git and the Unix Shell first.
- Explore the GitHub organization to see what the group is working on.
- Go and start making something brilliant!
