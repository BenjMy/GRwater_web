## Within the lab

* **Chat:** We have a lab chat room on [Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#compgeolab:matrix.org),
  which is the primary mode of communication for quick messages, announcements,
  reminders, and organizing meetings. Messages can be ephemeral so you cannot
  count of being able to read messages forever. **Use email if you need a
  record of the conversation.**
* **GitHub:** Each project is assigned a repository on our
  [GitHub account](https://github.com/compgeolab/).
  Reviews of code, text, etc., will be done through the repository. We'll also
  use to set goals and tasks.
* **Group meetings:** We will have *short* monthly group meetings for quick
  updates from everyone, general discussion, announcements, interesting papers,
  and informal chat.
* **Individual meetings:** We aim to have weekly individual meetings to discuss
  project status, goals, and work through problems and ideas.
* Group members are also encouraged to have meetings and messages with each
  other. **Don't wait until problems build up to seek guidance.**

## Using our website

* Source code used to generate the website:
  [compgeolab/website](https://github.com/compgeolab/website).
* Members are expected to post **short** news items when they do things of note
  (join the group, graduation, publication, conferences, awards, etc), as well
  as to update project and publication information.
* When joining the group, please submit a pull request adding yourself to the
  website. You are **not** required to provide a photo and contact information
  (but you certainly may if you feel comfortable having this information public
  on the internet).

## Social media

* In general, social media can be freely used if in line with the
  [University of Liverpool Social Media Policy](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/computingservices/regulations/social-media-policy.pdf).
* Lab members are encouraged to be respectful and kind while participating if
  they are representing themselves as lab members.
