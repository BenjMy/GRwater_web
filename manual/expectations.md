title: Expectations of lab members
---

We intend to foster a collegial lab atmosphere, with opportunities for
spontaneous discussions and creative opportunities.

* Lab members are **not** expected to sacrifice personal or leisure time in
  service of projects.
* Working long hours without interruption can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and
  overall **impedes** the type of atmosphere we are trying to develop.

Lab members should endeavor to be good University of Liverpool "citizens",
including:

* Participating in seminars and all-hands meetings.
* Contributing to department projects.
* Collaborating with individuals from other groups around campus.
* Fostering new collaborations both internal and external.

We strive to be a part of the intellectual community at the University of
Liverpool.
