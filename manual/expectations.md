<div class="lead">

We intend to foster a **healthy and collegial lab atmosphere**, with
opportunities for spontaneous discussions, creativity, close collaboration, and
career progression.

</div>

## Expectations of lab members

A large part of fostering a healthy work environment is taking care of our
mental well-being:

* Lab members are **not expected to sacrifice personal or leisure time** in
  service of projects.
* Working long hours without interruption can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and
  overall **impedes** the type of atmosphere we are trying to develop.
* Lab members are encouraged to **take anual breaks and vacation** time. This
  is particularly important after periods of high stress (exams, thesis
  defense, qualifying exams, workshops, etc). Please **let Leo know** when you
  will be away.

<div class="callout">

Time as a graduate students and as a postdoc is [known to cause undue
stress](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/anxiety-depression-mental-health-graduate-school/576769/),
resulting in consequences ranging from mild to extremely severe. **Please reach
out and use the resources in {{ macros.page_link("manual/health", page, site)
}} if you ever need help.**

</div>

We strive to be a part of the intellectual community at our host universities.
As such, lab members should endeavor to be **good university "citizens"**,
including:

* Participating in **department seminars**, meetings, and other academic activities.
* Collaborating with individuals from other groups/departments around campus.
* Fostering new collaborations, both internally and externally.

As lab members, Leo expects you to:

* Be proactive in communicating your needs and desires (guidance, equipment, personal time, career plans, chance of project/mentorship, etc).
* Be present and working regularly during term time. Please let Leo know if you are busy with other commitments (personal or academic) and won't be working on your project for a time.
* Follow the lab {{ macros.page_link("manual/coc", page, site) }} and general
  {{ macros.page_link("manual/open-science", page, site) }} guidelines.
* Keep on top of your own deadlines (assignments, reports, conferences, etc). Remember to give Leo **at least 1 week** (but preferably more) to give feedback on any piece of work. 
* Care for the physical environment of the lab, including lab computers.

## What you can expect from Leo

* Lead and set directions for the group's research efforts.
* Prioritize and support your career progression and well-being, providing the
  required training and resources for your praticular needs.
* Be willing to listen to critism and suggestions for improvement.
* Adjust the style of mentorship to what works best for you (please let me know
  if something isn't working well).
* Respond to your messages and requests within a reasonable time, which is
  around 1 day to 1 week depending on urgency and Leo's schedule.
* Respect your personal time and not ask for things to be done during evenings,
  weekends, holidays, and vacation time. You may get a message at these times
  due to Leo's own working hours but you have no obligation to respond.
* Seek funding to support lab activities, purchase equipment, scholarships, and
  conference attendance.
