When you first join the lab (ideally within the first few weeks), you will have
a **meeting with Leo** to introduce lab protocols, set expectations, add you to
communication channels, etc. It's also a good idea to read the lists below for
tips on what you should do and how to get accommodated in São Paulo.

## Things to do when joining the lab

1. Read the [lab Code of Conduct][coc] carefully.
1. Go over the rest of lab manual.
1. Get the password for the lab (room A-204) and a tour of what it offers.
1. Get a place to work and a computer in an office (for graduate students only)
   or the computer lab.
1. Create an account on the chat room (see {{ macros.page_link("manual/communication", page, site) }}) and send Leo a message (`@leouieda`) so he can add you to the `CompGeoLab` channel.
1. Install the [Mattermost app][mattermost]. You don't need to have it on your phone if you prefer not to, but at least install it on your computer.
1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Make sure your username is something that you would be OK putting on a publication or your CV (so nothing offensive, please).
1. Send Leo a message with your GitHub username so he can add you to the [lab GitHub organization][gh].
1. Study the [Software Carpentry][swc] lessons on Version Control with Git, Python, and the Unix Shell. They will be crucial for your project. Go over Git and the Unix Shell first.
1. Explore the GitHub organization to see what the group is working on.
1. Add yourself to the website (if you want). See the [Contributing Guide][website-contrib] for instructions.
1. Read the main references for your project (if Leo doesn't send them to you, please remind him).
1. Go and start making something brilliant!

## Things Leo has to do to get you setup

1. Introduce the [lab website][website] and [GitHub organization][gh] where all
   our research projects live.
1. Go over this manual.
1. Send a message to the group introducing the new member.
1. Add them to the [lab GitHub organization][gh].
1. Send the main papers related to the new member's project.
1. Add them to the lab calendar and recurring events (lab meetings, etc).

## Tips and tricks for studying at USP

1. There are [free buses](https://puspcb.usp.br/uso-do-campus/transportes-3/)
   that go from the Butantã metro station (yellow line) to various parts of
   campus. You'll first need to get a [BUSP card](https://www.puspc.usp.br/bilhete-usp-busp/)
   card to ride for free. But the buses also take regular cards (but will
   charge you). Beware that buses get very crowded during term time at peak
   hours (7-9 and 17-19).
1. If you live close to campus, riding a bike is usually the fastest way to get
   to IAG. [Jonny Bike](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jonny+Bike/@-23.5706632,-46.7085456,20.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x94ce57ab330d630d:0x84c90eb3d93746e1!8m2!3d-23.5708333!4d-46.7088889!16s%2Fg%2F1pv5xbkhp?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
   is a pretty good bike shop close to the subway station.
1. Make sure you have a [Bilhete Único](https://bilheteunico.sptrans.com.br/)
   to use public transport in São Paulo. Undergrad and graduate students should
   be eligible for a student card once enrolled but if you're new to São Paulo
   you should get a regular one as soon as you arrive to avoid paying more than
   you should for transport.
1. There are many apartments for rent close to the Butantã subway station and
   it's very good neighborhood. But it's also more expensive. Places further
   along Av. Corifeu de Azevedo Marques (Vila Indiana, Vila Universitária, Vila
   Butantã) and still offer good transport options to IAG. If living in Vila
   Indiana, it may be a good idea to get an electric bike since there is
   a steep hill to go anywhere.
