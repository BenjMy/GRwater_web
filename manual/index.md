## About

The lab manual outlines our principles, expectations, guidelines, on-boarding
process, and general information about how we operate as a research team.
This document is designed to be a reference for lab members and collaborators.
It's also part of an induction process when people join the lab.

**The manual is a living document.** Lab members are encouraged to submit fixes
and improvements to it. See the [Contributing Guide][website-repo] for this
website to find out how.
