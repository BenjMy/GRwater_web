## Entertainment in São Paulo

São Paulo is a massive city and a huge cultural center in Brazil. There are
many things to do, often for free, across the city.
Here are a few tips.

* Buses are free on Sundays. You can take as many as you'd like and they often
  won't be as crowded as on weekdays.
* Special bike lanes are installed on major streets and avenues during Sundays
  and holidays. They area great way to get to the many parks around the city.
* [SESC](https://www.sescsp.org.br/) has many units around the city that host
  concerts and art exhibits. The exhibits are usually free. They also have many
  free activities for children and a relatively cheap cafeteria for lunch.
* [Pinacoteca de São Paulo](https://pinacoteca.org.br/) and [Museu da Lingua
  Portuguesa](https://www.museudalinguaportuguesa.org.br/) are next to each
  other close to the Luz subway station. They are great and are both free on
  Saturdays.
