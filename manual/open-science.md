title: Our stance on Open Science
---

<div class="callout">
<p>
This document outlines how we approach science and collaboration at a
fundamental level.
<strong>It is vital that you are aware of and agree with these principles to a large
extent if you want to work with us</strong>.
</p>
</div>

**We have an open-by-default policy**, meaning that we assume that software and
data will be made openly available under permissive licenses
([CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0),
[BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), etc.)
unless there is a  **very** good reason not to
([PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information) or
other restrictions).

## General guidelines on openness

* Work on software should be conducted in public repositories.
* Papers, dissertations, and research projects may be held back as private
  until time of first submission, when they should be made public for
  peer-review.
* Because most repositories will be made publicly accessible, including their
  entire history, lab members are required to behave professionally in them
  (including commit messages, issues, pull requests, code comments, etc).
* Many journals consider the content of referee reports to be confidential.
  Unless the report is explicitly open, it should **not** be added to
  repositories as text, commit messages, or comments in papers.
* Grant proposals developed internally with no external PIs or Co-PIs should be
  made available unless there is confidential information.
* Grant proposals developed in collaboration with external PIs or Co-PIs may be
  kept confidential at the external collaborators discretion, although our
  preference is for them to be open.

## Data and code availability

* All data and models generated by the lab will be made available in both raw
  and processed forms under
  [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) or
  [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) licenses.
* All software will be made available in source form under permissive,
  BSD-style licenses, unless constrained by external copyleft licensing.
* Source code will be made publicly available on GitHub (or similar),
  with additional backups possible.
* Every effort will be made to preserve integrity and accessibility of data.

## Reproducibility

* All necessary components to provide reproducibility of a scholarly work
  should be provided in a publicly accessible location and as part of the
  scientific record (e.g., by including DOIs to data archives in papers).
* The only exception is when strongly prohibited by external concerns (private
  or sensitive data, etc).
* Method development papers must include:
  1. The source code that implements the methodology.
  1. Analysis code that generated plots and results from the paper.
* The additional overhead of making work reproducible should not be onerous
  compared to the other expectations, and can actually reduce the overall
  effort of developing papers and workflows.
* We will endeavor to respond to requests to reproduce our results by providing
  necessary technology and data, allowing for reasonable commitments of time
  and effort.
