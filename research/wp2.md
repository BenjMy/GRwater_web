from time lapse ERT observations. Is(t) represent the partitionning of the rain from the tree canopy and the
effect of stemflow, Ks1 to Ks3 are the soil hydraulic conductivities that plays a key role in water infiltration
rate and that are unknowns model parameters that are inverted (infered during the DA process), RWU is the
