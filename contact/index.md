## Collaborations

We're always interested in new collaborations and interesting projects.
We'd love to hear from you if your project or idea could benefit from our
expertise in data analysis, inverse problems, and research software
engineering.

**Reach out** to [our team](/team) to start a conversation!

**Before you decide to work with us:** read the
[Lab Manual](https://github.com/compgeolab/manual) carefully to make sure you
agree with our stance on open-access, FAIR data/software, and overall work
ethics.
